# Find Possible Words from Phonemes

### Created by Kamaljit Grewal. March 2024.

This is a solution to the following question: Given a sequence of phonemes as input (e.g. ["DH", "EH", "R", "DH", "EH", "R"]), find all the combinations of the words that can produce this sequence (e.g. [["THEIR", "THEIR"], ["THEIR", "THERE"], ["THERE", "THEIR"], ["THERE", "THERE"]]). You can preprocess the dictionary into a different data structure if needed.

This code utilizes Carnegie Mellon Univeristy's pronouncing dictionary as well as some starter code from kaggle user snimrexzeo (with edits from me) to perform data cleaning. Code to find the word combinations is all written by me.

Coded in Python in Jupyter Notebooks.
